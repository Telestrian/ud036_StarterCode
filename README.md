# Udacity Movie Trailer Project
This is a website that is generated using Python that lists movies specified
by objects in the entertainment_center and allows for YouTube trailers to be
displayed when a movie's name or poster is clicked.

I changed some of the appearance of the Fresh Tomatoes website from the default
to make the display of movies with long titles work better. I also
increased the size of the posters for readability and made the YouTube
trailers display in a larger iframe.

This project was interesting for me as generating the movie by embedding the
HTML/CSS/JS within Python as a massive string that could then be used in a
website creating function to build a website was something I had not thought of
doing before.

I look forward to learning more about web development with Udacity.
