# Udacity Movie Trailer Project
This is a website that is generated using Python that lists movies specified
by objects in the entertainment_center and allows for YouTube trailers to be
displayed when a movie's name or poster is clicked.

I changed some of the appearance of the Fresh Tomatoes website from the default
to make the display of movies with long titles work better. I also
increased the size of the posters for readability and made the YouTube
trailers display in a larger iframe.

This project was interesting for me as generating the movie by embedding the
HTML/CSS/JS within Python as a massive string that could then be used in a
website creating function to build a website was something I had not thought of
doing before.

I look forward to learning more about web development with Udacity.

## Getting Started

You can generate the page by cloning or downloading this project
and running the `entertainment_center.py` file. 

You can run the file by installing Python 2.7 and running the command
`python entertainment_center.py` 
from within the directory you have downloaded this project into.

Alternatively you can run it from within an IDE like IDLE or PyCharm by 
opening fresh_tomatoes.py within the IDE and running it.

## Prerequisites

To run this you will need to have Python 2.7 installed. I recommend downloading
Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/), and it comes packaged with some Linux
distributions.

You can verify that Python is installed correctly by using the command 
`python --version` on your command line or terminal.

You should expect output in the form `Python 2.7.xx`. The program may not run
correctly if you use Python 3.
